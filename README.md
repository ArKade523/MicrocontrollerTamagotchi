# Microcontroller Tamagotchi

This is a project to create a Tamagotchi-esque device using a microcontroller, three buttons, and a small 64x128 pixel display.

I am also using Raylib, a C++ graphics library, to test my Tamagotchi game code.

Installation instructions for Raylib can be found [here](https://www.raylib.com/#supported-platforms). Choose your development platform from the list.

This has all been built by Kade Angell, created for fun
