# Microcontroller Tamagotchi

This is a project to create a Tamagotchi-esque device using a microcontroller, three buttons, and a small 64x128 pixel display.

Component list:
- [Microcontroller](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html)
- Generic push-buttons
- [64x128px Display](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3L7N917?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
- Generic 1000mAh LiPo battery
- Generic TP4056 charging board

I am also using Raylib, a C++ graphics library, to test my Tamagotchi game code.

Installation instructions for Raylib can be found [here](https://www.raylib.com/#supported-platforms). Choose your development platform from the list.

This has all been built by Kade Angell, created for fun
